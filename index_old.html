                        ### Frank Ramsey

                        A contribution to theory of taxation 1927

                        > The problem I propose to tackle is this: a given revenue is to be raised
                        by proportionate taxes on some or all uses of income, the taxes of
                        different uses being possibly at different rates: **how should these rates
                        being adjusted in order that the decrement of utility may be minimum?**

                        > We denote by $u=F\left(x_{1},x_{n}\right)$ the net utility of producing
                        and consuming (or saving) these quantitites of commodities.
                        Suppose taxes are levied on the different commodities at a rate
                        $\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},..,\lambda_{n}$\...

                        > I.e., $u$ is to be maximum subject to $\sum\lambda_{r}x_{r}=R$ (where
                        $\lambda_{r}$ is $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_{r}}$)\...and so we have
                        `$$\begin{aligned}
                        \frac{\lambda_{1}}{\sum_{s}x_{s}\frac{\partial\lambda_{s}}{\partial x_{s}}} & =\frac{\lambda_{2}}{\sum_{s}x_{s}\frac{\partial\lambda_{s}}{\partial x_{d}}}=...=\frac{\lambda_{n}}{\sum_{s}x_{s}\frac{\partial\lambda_{s}}{\partial x_{n}}}\\
                        & =\frac{R}{\sum_{r}\sum_{s}\frac{\partial\lambda_{s}}{\partial x_{d}}x_{r}x_{s}}\end{aligned}$$`

                        > i.e **the production of each commodity should be diminished in the same
                        proportion**.

                        ---

                        <!-- .slide: style="text-align: left;" -->


                       
                        > I shall assume the utility is a non-homogeneous quadratic function\...The taxes should be such as to dimish the production of all commodities
                        in the same direction. And this result is now valid for an infinitesimal
                        revenue but for any revenue which it is possible to raise at all.

                        > We can now consider the more general problem: a given revenue is to be
                        raised by means of fixed taxes $\mu_{1}...\mu_{n}$ on $m$ commodities
                        and by taxes to be chosen at discretion on the remainder.

                        > First suppose that all commodities are independent and have their own
                        supply an demand equations\...hence if we denote by $\rho_r$ and $\epsilon_r$
                        the elasticities od demand and supply...
                        $$\mu_{r}=\frac{\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{r}}+\frac{1}{\rho_{r}}\right)\theta}{1-\frac{\theta}{\rho_{r}}}$$
                        
                        > For infinitesimal taxes...
                        `$$\frac{\mu_{1}}{\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}}+\frac{1}{\rho_{1}}}=...\frac{\mu_{n}}{\frac{1}{\epsilon_{n}}+\frac{1}{\rho_{n}}}$$`
                         i.e. the tax ad valorem on each commodity should be proportional to the
                        sum of the reciprocals ot its supply and demand elasticities

                        > \....If any one commodity is absolutely inelastic, either for supply or
                        for demand, the whole of the revenue should be collected off it.

                        A Mathematical Theory of Saving 1928

                        > The first problem I propose to tackle is this: **how much of its income
                        should a nation save?**\...

                        > The rate of saving multiplied by the marginal utility of money should
                        always be equal to the amount by which the total net rate of enjoyment of
                        utility falls short of the maximum possible rate of enjoyment.

                        > \...various simplifying assumptions: we have to suppose that our
                        community goes on for ever without changing either in numbers or in its
                        capacity for enjoyment or on its aversion to labour; can be
                        calculated\...and added\...no new invention\...

                        > \...it is assumed that **we do not discount later enjoyments in comparison
                        with earlier ones, a practive which is ethically indefensible and arises
                        merely from the weakness of the imagination**; we shall however in Section
                        II include such a rate of discount in some of our investigations.

                        A Mathematical Theory of Saving 1928


                        > Let us then denote by $x(t)$ and $a(t)$ the total rates of consumption
                        and labour of our community and by $c(t)$ it capital at time $t$. Its
                        income is taken to be a general function of the amount of labour and
                        capital, and will be called $f(a,c)$;\...
                        $$\frac{dc}{dt}+x=f\left(a,c\right)$$

                        > Now let us denote by $U(x)$ the total rate of consumption $x$, and by
                        $V(a)$ the total rate of disutility of a rate of labour $a$; and the
                        corresponding marginal rates we will call $u(x)$ and $v(a)$;

                        > The first of these comes from equating the marginal disutility of labour
                        at any time to the product of the marginal efficiency of labour by the
                        marginal utility of consumption at that time
                        $$v(a)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial a}u(x)$$

                        > The second equates the advantage of an increment $\Delta x$ of
                        consumption at time $t$, to that derived by postponning it for an
                        infinitesimal period $\Delta t$, which will increase its amount to
                        $\Delta x\left(1+\frac{\partial f}{\partial c}\Delta t\right)$since
                        $\frac{\partial f}{\partial c}$ gives the rate of interest earned by
                        waiting\...or in the limit
                        $$\frac{d}{dt}u\left(x\left(t\right)\right)=-\frac{\partial f}{\partial c}u\left(x\left(t\right)\right)$$

                        > Mr. Keynes ... has shown me that this result can also be obtained by the following simpple reasoning.
                        Suppose that in a year we ought to spen x and save z. Then the advantage to be gained
                        from an extra 1 spent is $u(x)$, the marginal utility of money, and this must be equated
                        to the sacrifice imposed by saving 1 less.

                        > Equations (1),(2) and (3) are sufficient to solve our problem provided we
                        know $c_{0}$, the given capital with whioch the nation starts at $t=0$ ,
                        the other "initial condition" being supplied by considerations as to the
                        behavior of the function as $t\rightarrow\infty$.

                        > \...different people discount future utility at different rates, and,
                        quite apart from the time factor, are not so interested in their heirs
                        as in themselves.

                        > Let us suppose that they are not concerned with their heirs at all; that
                        each man is charged with a share of the maintenance of such children as
                        are necessary to maintain the population, but **starts his working life
                        without any capital and ends it without any, having spent his savings on
                        an annuity**; that within his own lifetime he has a constant utility
                        schedule for consumption and discounts future utility at a constant
                        rate, but that this rate may be supposed different for different people.

                        > When such a community is in equilibrium, the rate of interest must, of
                        course, equal the demand price of capital at
                        $\frac{\partial f}{\partial c}$. And it will also equal the 'supply
                        price', which arises in the following way. Suppose that the rate of
                        interest is constant and equal to $r$, and that the rate of discount for
                        a given individual is $\rho$. Then if $r>\rho$, he will save when he is
                        young, not only to provide for loss of earning power in old age, but
                        also because he can get more pounds to spend at a later date for those
                        he forgoes spending now. If we neglect variations in his earning power,
                        his action can be calculated by modifying the equations of lIc to apply
                        to a finite life as in IIb. He will for a time accumulate capital, and
                        then spend it before he dies. Besides this man, we must suppose there to
                        be in our community other men, exactly like him except for being born at
                        different times. The total capital possessed by $n$ men of this sort whose
                        birthdays are spread evenly through the period of a lifetime will be $n$
                        times the average capital possessed by each in the course of his life.
                        The class of men of this sort will, therefore, possess a constant
                        capital depending on the rate of interest, and this will be the amount
                        of capital supplied by them at that price. (If $\rho>r$, it may be
                        negative, as they may borrow when young and pay back when old). We can
                        then obtain the total supply curve of capital by adding together the
                        supplies provided at a given price by each class of individual.

                        Let $X$ be a consumption set, namely the set of all alternatives the
                        consumer can conceive, with $x_{i}$ the number of units of good $i$. The
                        requirements on $X$ are that 1. $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$, 2. $X$
                        is closed , 3. $X$ is convex.4. $0\in X$.
                        
                        Imposing some properties on a preference relation such as
                        
                        -   Completeness: for all $x^{1}$ and $x^{2}$ in $X$ either
                            $x^{1}\gtrsim x^{2}$ or $x^{2}\gtrsim x^{1}$.
                        
                        -   Transitivity: For any three elements $x^{1},x^{2}$ and $x^{3}$in $X$
                            if $x^{1}\gtrsim x^{2}$ and $x^{2}\gtrsim x^{3}$ then
                            $x^{1}\gtrsim x^{3}$

                        They imply that there is a real valued function $u(x)$ (utility) that
                        represents these preferences. (Wold, Debreu)

                        Von Neumann interpreted $X$ as outcomes $a_{i}$ (gambles) that had a
                        probability $p$, with two more axioms

                        He proved that there exists an expected utility
                        $$u(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}u\left(a_{i}\right)$$

                        USEFULNESS OF REAL ANALYSIS

                        Example of how to prove existence in this framework. Brouwer's fixed
                        point theorem
                        
                        > Recall that a set of points is said to be compact if it is closed and
                        bounded and to be convex if every line segment joining two points of the
                        set lies entirely within the set. Let $C$ be a compact convex set. Let
                        $f(x)$ be a vector function which assigns to every point of $C$ a point
                        of $C$. Then Brouwer's theorem asserts that if the mapping $f(x)$ is
                        continuous, then there is at least one point, `$x^{*}$`, which is mapped
                        into itself, i.e., for which `$f(x^{*})=x^{*}$`.

                        ### Robert Lucas 1937-? (Nobel 1995)

                        Lucas methodological agenda: construct a microfounded rational
                        expectation dynamic model for short-run or business-cycle.

                        Microfoundations allow to compute welfare measures. Rational
                        expectations and microfoundations allow to compute the implications of
                        future policies on future behavior and vice versa.

                        The model should be an explicit description of the way the economy
                        evolves through time. This achieved by spelling out stochastic systems
                        described by the law of motion of the state of the system $s_{t}$
                        $$s_{t+1}=F(s_{t},e_{t}),$$ where $e_{t}$ is a vector of exogenous
                        shocks drawn from $G(e)$.

                        ---

                        <!-- .slide: style="text-align: left;" -->


                        Distinguish actions of agents $a_{it}=a(s_{t})$ and policies
                        $z_{t}=z(s_{t})$, then if $s_{t+1}=H(z_{t},a_{t},s_{t},e_{t})$ we can
                        express $F$ as $$F(s_{t},e_{t})=H(z(s_{t}),a(s_{t}),s_{t},e_{t}).$$

                        This is progress (structural) if ($H(.)$ and) $a(.)$ do not change in
                        responses to (known) changes in $z(.).$

                        Lucas critique: there is no reason to expect that the function $a(.)$
                        remain invariant under changes in the function $z(.)$.

                        ---

                        Solution builds a more formal structure. Let us assume that at a given
                        date, when the system is in state $s$, nature selects an action $z$ and
                        each agent $i$ selects an action $a_{i}$ from an opportunity set
                        $\Omega_{i}(a_{-i},s$ ,$z)$ that is determined by $s,z,$ and the actions
                        $a_{-i}$ of the other agents.

                        Denote the payoff of agent $i$ given all of those actions
                        $R_{i}(a,s,z)$. Assume an agent seeks to maximize:
                        `$$E\left\{ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\beta^{t}R_{i}(a_{t},s_{t},z_{t})\right\} .$$`

                        $E$ is mathematical expectation conditioned on the initial information
                        $s_{0}$, the mathematical form of rational expectations.
